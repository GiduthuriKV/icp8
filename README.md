# icp8


Loaded the cifar10 dataset and split into train and test data with 80% train data and 20% test data 
with to_categorical we are differentiating it into multiple categories
Using ImageDataGenerator we are fit and train the obtained image data then created the Sequential model
using the optimizers we just optimized the model to train fast and fit and trained to the Sequential model
and got the required results and plot the required graphs with the obtained results.
In the first code we used and sequential model of vgg19
and in the second code everything is same but we used sequential model of vgg16
